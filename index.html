                The article explains in an understandable manner the fundamental nature of code and how it has provided a gateway to accelerate development for the web. It introduces the different coding languages that are in use today, how they differentiate from one another, and when to use which. It was interesting to see how the languages develop with different functions in mind and how that makes the accessibility and efficiency of the languages different. Interactive design makes it clear for the reader/audience to understand the concept more easily. </p>

              <div class="grid-item"><h3>What Screens Want</h3> <p>

                The article suggests that the screens are a visual gate between the developers and the viewers, and how the screen serves as a medium to carry the developer’s messages. It argues that the content should come before the screens. This is accentuated by the unconventional layout of the article, which gave a different feeling compared to other articles that the common audience is used to. Combined with the unusual concepts such as skeuomorphs, it makes I can’t say I had the most fun reading the piece.

              <div class="grid-item"><h3>Vernacular Web</h3> <p>

                The article shines light to the history of web development and the elements that have disappeared during the process. It goes into detail about the trends that used to be predominant but are in no use today/improved, such as the bit about the tilde (~). It was interesting to see how so much has changed over a relatively short period of time and what stayed and what disappeared.

                <h3>Jodi’s Infrastructure</h3>
                <p>
                  The article poses a question about art and technology, and whether the two could be integrated. There is a common belief/consensus that the digital realm is not “real” art, and that there is no creative or artistic elements associated with it. Although the web is arguably leaning towards the practical side, today, the trend is to blur the line between the two. Examples like infographics, web portfolios and many more are evidence of artists and technicians joining together to utilize both creative and practical potential of the web/tech.

                  <h3>Capitalism vs Privacy</h3> <p>

                  The article reminds the readers about the exploitation of privacy and corporates taking advantage of the user information. It is no news at this point with Facebook and what not, but there is a side in me that thinks that it’s the users fault for giving them out as well. However, companies should also specify what the information they’ve gathered is used for. The communication between both side is key.

                  <h3>Critical Atlas of Internet</h3> <p>

                  The article visualizes the internet with diagrams (so many of it) in order to inform the the readers of the intricate web shared between different organizations. Since there were so many diagrams, some over laid on top of another, that made it difficult for me to process the information. It was interesting to see the relationship between websites nevertheless.

                  <h3>New Clues</h3>
                  <p> Compared to other articles presented in class, this article (rather a manifesto)is much more broad and challenges the readers to think about the internet in a more critical light. the article poses a question about the conversational aspect and how anonymity creates an environment open for everyone.
